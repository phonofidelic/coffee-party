   - Who We Are
   - What We Do
   - Why choose us?
   - Coffee Party Events!
2. **Products and events**:
   - Products section showing different models of coffee machines in a grid
   - Events section with sub-sections for B2B and B2C
3. **About us**:

   - Profile and contact info for the CEO
   - Profile and contact info for the head of HR

The website should display correctly both on mobile and desktop devices.

## Toolkit
